# Job Portal React App

A simple job portal application built with **React**.  
This project demonstrates job filtering, search, navigation across multiple pages, and external job-related resources — all in a clean, responsive UI.

This project is part of my developer portfolio to showcase:
- React component architecture
- State management with `useState`
- Reusable components (`JobCard`)
- Page switching without external routing libraries
- UI/UX design using CSS

---

## 🚀 Demo

**Local Development:**  

App will run at:  
👉 `http://localhost:3001`

## 📌 Features

### 🔍 Job Search + Filtering
- Search by job title or company
- Filter by job type (Full-time, Internship, Part-time)
- Clean grid layout for job cards
- Reusable `JobCard` component

### 📝 Apply Button
- Each job card includes a working "Apply" button that opens the application link
- URLs can be easily updated in the job data file

### 🧭 Multi-Page Navigation (Without Router)
A lightweight navbar allows switching between:
- **Home** – job listings + search + filter
- **Tips** – resume & interview advice
- **Other Job Portals** – curated links to LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, Wellfound, etc.

All implemented using simple React state (`useState`) to avoid over-complication.

### 🎨 Responsive UI
- Modern layout
- Accessible color palette
- Styled with CSS (no external UI library)

- Add a dedicated **Job Details Page**
- Add an **admin mode** to add/edit/delete jobs
- Add animations + transitions
- Deploy to **Vercel** or **Netlify**

## ✨ Purpose

This project was built to practice:

- Front-end React development
- Organizing a multi-section application
- Designing clean UI layouts
- Creating re-usable components
- Preparing portfolio-ready work for SWE job applications
